# The Cosmic Cup

There is a small coffee shop in Easton, PA called <a
href="http://cosmiccupcoffee.com">The Cosmic Cup</a> that I used to frequent as
a senior at Lafayette College. I liked the shop and their efforts to support
organic coffee growers. I did a quick redesign of their website one day and
emailed the owner asking if they wanted to use it. Since I never heard back from
them I'm releasing it here.

You can see what the design <a href="http://basus.me/cosmic-cup/">looks like
here</a>. I used images from the <a href="http://cosmiccupcoffee.com">original
Cosmic Cup page</a>. The code for it is on Github.
